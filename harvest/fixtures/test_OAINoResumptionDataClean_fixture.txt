<dc:description>This thesis examines the exegetical, intellectual-historical, and theoretical implications of a particular feature of Philip Sidney?s late sixteenth-century sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella:  its continual anxiety over authenticity ? a term I use to signal the ability of its fictional speaker (Astrophil) to find a language capable of conveying his internal cognitive and affective states.  Throughout Sidney?s sequence, Astrophil attempts to define an authentic lyrical language by both criticizing other poets and asserting a formal agenda for his own texts.  His texts, however, continually contradict in practice what is demanded of them in theory so that the sequence shows an underlying pessimism summed up in Sonnet 35?s question: ?What may words say, or what may words not say, / Where Truth itself must speake like Flatterie?? (my emphasis).&#xd;
This paradox and the pessimism it produces, I argue, can be understood by situating Sidney?s sequence in a rift between two conceptual frameworks for understanding relations between subjectivity, language, and the material world.  In one framework (dominant in western medieval Christendom), cognition, language, and material things were seen as ontologically homogenous ? part of the same sublunary, postlapsarian material stratum.  But in another framework ? emerging in the sixteenth century and that would become dominant in western European modernity ? human subjects and their languages were seen as detached from the material world.   Sidney?s sequence, I suggest, is stuck between these two ideological polarities.  It wants to enact an authenticity that would become possible under the conceptual regime of modernity, where language is imbricated in the immaterial cognitive circuitry of sovereign, Cartesian subjects, and where it thus becomes capable of conveying the authenticity attributed to in modern ideologies of the aesthetic.  However, Sidney is caught in the conceptual space of an older model of language:  one that sees it as something thingly, ontologically homogenous with the material world.  &#xd;
My first chapter introduces ? somewhat lengthily ? the problem of authenticity in Astrophil and Stella.  It develops some of the intellectual-historical horizons I want to situate the sequence in and introduces the main textual feature I want to follow:  Sidney?s tendency, in attempting to establish the authenticity of his own poetry, to criticize other poets for their lack of authenticity vis-?-vis a resemblance between their poetic practices and commercial and economic practices.  My second chapter both turns to the contemporary critical landscape of early modern studies and provides further elaboration of my positioning of Sidney in the ambiguities of early modern concepts of subjectivity, language, and materiality.  After this lengthy prefatory, I move on, in my third chapter, to read Astrophil and Stella, focusing particularly on Sidney?s use of the word ?strange? ? a term that particularly points to the rift I want to chart in the sequence.  My fourth chapter concludes with a methodological question:  how do the points I have made about the difference between modern and early modern ontologies of language, materiality, and subjectivity effect the contemporary critical landscape of early modern literary studies.  Particularly, I pursue the question of whether or not a return to formalism and aestheticism (increasingly called for in protest to the dominance of cultural studies in literary interpretation) has a trans-historical exegetical validity.  In conclusion, I suggest that the assumptions on which such a return to the literary would stand become deeply problematic outside of the modern era.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis examines Virginia Woolf?s 1923 novel Jacob?s Room as a transmission of what Woolf in her unfinished memoir refers to as ?shocks.?  In A Sketch of the Past, Woolf describes the experience of these shocks and her immediate desire to explain them, presenting writing as a reparative activity that imparts meaning to the apparently senseless and alleviates pain by creating wholeness out of fragmentation.  She illustrates this concept by providing three examples from her own childhood, each of which offers a very different model of experience.  In this thesis I relate these shocks to the structure of Jacob?s Room and a number of strangely digressive and open-ended passages within it, proposing that the novel actually resists Woolf's own model of reparative writing and does not process shocks into wholes for the reader so much as transmit them to her.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Honors Chemistry Thesis</dc:description>
<dc:description>In my study, I attempt to create a unique and more biologically relevant model of the&#xd;
cholesterol-rich exoplasmic leaflet of animal plasma membranes. Using electroswelling to create giant unilamellar vesicles, fluorescence microscopy, and the previously completed ternary mixture of DOPC, DSPC, and cholesterol, DOPC, a rare biological lipid, was gradually replaced with SOPC, an abundant biological lipid in order to create a partially completed quaternary phase diagram consisting of DOPC, SOPC, DSPC, and cholesterol. Focusing on the biological raft region, (Lo+Lα coexistence phase), reduction in the size of the coexistence region was found, thus verifying the notion that SOPC is more miscible with DSPC and cholesterol than is DOPC. DOPC replacements greater than 70% resulted in a disappearance of the coexistence region leading to a suspicion that the phase domains were too small to observe using optical fluorescence microscopy. The creation of a more biological model membrane can be used to further understand the role of lipids and proteins in cellular membranes as well as the size of biological rafts important in cellular function.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Plasma membrane (PM) association is an essential step in the retroviral life cycle that involves the complex association of the Gag polyprotein with cellular machinery, RNA, and specific lipid signatures of the inner leaflet. Here, I describe the first systematic comparison of Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) Gag membrane binding properties using in vitro liposome binding assays, in vivo virus release assays, and localization studies using confocal microscopy of 293T cells. By doing so, I hoped to address two main questions. First, what drives EIAV Gag association with the plasma membrane? And second, why is EIAV Gag not myristoylated? My results showed that EIAV Gag membrane association is driven by electrostatic interactions and a preference for cholesterol-containing membranes. These results highlight the universal importance of electrostatic interactions for retroviral Gag PM targeting and may underline a shared association with lipid raft microdomains for budding. I also used EIAV matrix (MA) and HIV-1 MA mutants to confirm HIV-1’s dependence on myristoylation for virus release and localization to the plasma membrane. These same mutants have also led me to propose a model for EIAV MA helix 1 inhibition of myristoylation. Finally, a part of my thesis work has been dedicated to the development of a novel silica-bead binding assay to study protein-lipid interactions. I describe this work in Appendix 1.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Central pattern generators (CPGs) are important neuronal networks that are made up of interneurons that organize rhythmic motor output such as respiration, mastication, and locomotion. Locomotor CPGs are located in the spinal cord of all vertebrates. Interneurons have been shown to be a necessary part of regulating the coordination of the left and right flexor and extensor muscles that generate the normal walking movement. The V2a interneurons, in particular, play an important role in maintaining a left-right alternating hindlimb pattern at high speeds. Two key players of the CPGs are serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin transporters (SERT). 5-HT plays an important role in enabling the network to generate the locomotor rhythm in rodents, while SERT is responsible for high affinity uptake of 5-HT to terminate its activity in the synaptic cleft. Using double immunohistochemical methods, I determined that not only are 5-HT and SERT co-localized in 5-HT terminals, but also 5-HT and SERT–labeled terminals are located on V2a interneurons. Using Sholl analysis, I determined that SERT and 5-HT show similar co-localization patterns on the V2a interneurons. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) typically does not inflict physical damage to the cells that make up the hindlimb CPG, it results in a loss of motor function by removing descending input from the brain. This in turn can induce changes in CPG cellular activity and transmitter sensitivity. Thus, I sought to observe how SCI affects expression levels of 5-HT and SERT. After SCI, a loss of motor function occurs due to the changes in cellular activity and sensitivity in the CPG. Using single immunohistochemical methods, I determined that both 5-HT and SERT decrease significantly in area and intensity after SCI.</dc:description>

<dc:description>VU573 is a synthetic organic molecule weighing 350 daltons, found to block inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in high-throughput screening. In order to evaluate VU573 as a novel pesticide capable of inducing mosquito renal failure, electrophysiological analyses were carried out on isolated Malpighian tubules from the female yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Using the Malpighian tubule electrophysiology protocol developed in the laboratory of Klaus W. Beyenbach, exposure to 10µM peritubular VU573 was found to (1) hyperpolarize the basolateral membrane of isolated tubules by an average of 6.76 ± 1.27 mV (p&lt;0.00012) and (2) increase cell input resistance by an average of 7.02 ± 1.31 kΩ (p&lt;0.002) in conditions of potassium overload (34mM [K+] peritubular). These results confirm a block of A. aegypti Kir1 (AeKir1) expressed at the basolateral surface of stellate cells, which seem to be less involved in transport than their counterparts—the principal cells. Additional experiments establish that the 10µM VU573 dosage is equally as effective as the 50µM dosage (p=0.88). Furthermore, I-V plots taken of Malpighian tubules demonstrate that different tubules exhibit different degrees of rectification, from no rectification (Ohmic) to very strong rectification.&#xd;
	The barium ion is known to strongly block all Kir channels. With the same protocol used for VU573, 5mM barium was tested and found to (1) hyperpolarize the tubule basolateral membrane by 11.91 ± 3.82 mV (p&lt;0.008) and (2) increase cell input resistance by 123.58 ± 12.93 kΩ (p&lt;0.0003). The much smaller resistance increase with VU573 compared to barium, coupled with the laboratory of Peter M. Piermarini’s finding of AeKir1 on stellate cells, suggests that AeKir1 channels are less involved with potassium transport and likely serve other functions, such as potassium sensing or cellular housekeeping. Taken in all, VU573 is effective at blocking AeKir1 but would need to be refined further to have an even more potent antidiuretic effect.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Previous experiments have shown two germline stem cell genes, bam and bgcn, to be under strong positive selection in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans (Bauer DuMont et al. 2007).  This prompted the question of whether the same pattern of selection observed in these two species was present in the germline stem cell genes of other Drosophila lineages?  The Aquadro Lab has been sequencing many germline stem cell genes in Drosophila species, and the answer to this question so far has been that some lineages show strong positive selection and some do not.  This observation led the Aquadro Lab to begin to test hypotheses about the driver – or drivers – of the positive selection in the germline stem cell genes across some Drosophila lineages.  One hypothesis proposed by Bauer DuMont et al. (2007) is that coevolution with pathogens such as the reproductive parasite, Wolbachia pipientis, infecting the germline could be driving this observed selection.  This project looked for signs of selection in the germline stem cell genes stonewall and otefin, two genes that have shown signs of positive selection in other Drosophila species, which the Aquadro Lab has previously tested.  These two genes were sequenced in Drosophila pseudoobscura, a species of Drosophila that is not currently known to be infected with Wolbachia.  This project shows that both genes do not show evidence of long term, repeated positive selection, but both genes do show evidence for a more recent selective sweep.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This Anthropology honors thesis combines Anthropology, Archaeology, and Museum Studies to discusses the history and analyzes the importance of the William Henry Sage Collection of Casts, which was brought to Cornell University by A. D. White in the early 1890s and placed on display in 1894. The Cast Collection, some whose fragmented pieces reside in Goldwin Smith Hall to this day, was a pinnacle collection of the University and brought much fame and acclaim to the institution. However, it was never stagnant and saw many phases of reinterpretation and curation. Through such modification, each iteration of the collection was used to echo the educational mood and focus of the contemporary University. Interestingly, regardless of prominence, level of care, or mode of display, students throughout time have often developed personal relationships with the individual statues of the Cast Collection. They may fear or love the pieces, but most admit it all has something to do with looking through the statue's eyes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus; Cyprinodontiformes) are intertidal killifish that can breathe air and locomote on land. Our goals were to characterize the terrestrial locomotion of mummichogs and determine their method of navigation towards water in a terrestrial environment. We used high-speed video to record behavior during stranding experiments and found that mummichogs use a tail-flip jump to move overland, similarly to other Cyprinodontiformes. However, mummichogs also prop themselves upright into a prone position between each jump, a previously undescribed behavior. After becoming prone, mummichogs rotate about their vertical axis, directing the caudal fin towards the water. Then, they roll back onto their lateral aspect and use a tail-flip behavior to leap into a caudally-directed, ballistic flight path. We conducted experiments to determine the sensory stimulus used to locate a body of water by placing mummichogs on a square platform with one side adjacent to a sea table. Under artificial light, mummichogs moved towards the sea table with a higher frequency than towards the other sides. Under dark conditions, mummichogs did not show a preference for moving towards the sea table. When the surface of the water was covered with reflective foil, mummichogs moved towards it as if it were a body of water. These results suggest that mummichogs primarily use visual cues, specifically reflected light, to orient towards the water. The uprighting behavior that mummichogs perform between terrestrial jumps may provide an opportunity for these fish to receive visual information that allows them to safely return to the water.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have exciting medical potential, especially those that are genetically modified. Non-viral methods for genetic modification present several advantages over viral methods, and hence, such methods have been optimized for MSCs from a variety of species. Although equine MSCs have great importance, prior to this study, effective non-viral transfection parameters for these cells had not been determined. Here both chemical and physical transfection methods were optimized for equine MSCs, using red fluorescent protein as a reporter gene. Chemical reagents were optimized for reagent-to-DNA ratio, transfection solution plating volume, and cell density. Additionally, ideal voltage, cell concentration, DNA concentration, buffer, and pulse number settings were discovered for electroporation. The method resulting in highest gene expression was electroporation with one 30-msec pulse at 170 volts in Opti-Mem buffer. This technique resulted in transfection of 54% of the cell population, a percentage that is on the higher end of nonviral MSC transfection efficiencies. The transfection parameters determined in this study will undoubtedly be useful to all researchers who wish to genetically modify equine MSCs.</dc:description>
